fsl (space segment) is responsible for communication to and from the satellite.
gsl (ground segment) is responsible for communication to and from the satellite at the ground.
The communication link is simulated using udp.

There are several applications (apps) at the space segment.
Each app has one or more uds channels to fsl for downlink (dl) messages (e.g: for high/low priority).
Each app has one uds channel for uplink (ul) messages (comming from the ground and ending at the specific app).

For downlink messages, fsl is the uds server.
For uplink messages, fsl is the uds client.

Downlink (dl) messages accepted from an app at some uds server should be sent via udp to gsl.

Uplink Messages received via udp socket should be routed to the correct uds client based on the message opcode.

I want config.xml to define a set of server uds for downlink messages (one or more per each app) 
and a set of client uds for uplink messages (one per each app).

I also want to define a mapping between message opcodes and uds names for ul messages.
The uds names in the mapping should match the client uds names defined earlier.
